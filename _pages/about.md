Hi! Thanks for stopping by! 

# Who am I 

I am a highly motivated, problem solving driven chemist who also understand scripting languages. My research projects range from microscope building to data interpretation, during which I often enjoyed the process trouble-shooting, which involves pin-pointing the bug and find ways to solve. 


# What are my passions

- Troubleshoot why electronics don't work in the [third-floor system](http://www.chem.purdue.edu/simpson/)
- Collect data and analyze the factors, correlations between factors, a.k.a [researching](https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10209081)
- [Write bugs](https://github.itap.purdue.edu/Simpson-Laboratory-for-Nonlinear-Optics/GALDA-public) and debug them
- Catching up with whats new in ML and debating whether people should stick to good old chemometrics/multi-variate analysis
- Typesetting, Latexing
- Play the guitar and [write songs](https://www.instagram.com/yliu0593/)
