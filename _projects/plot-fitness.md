At the time, I was in full motivated mode to keep tracking my fitness data for a year (until the pandemic happened and me quarantining with my food turned out to be not a good idea). 
I had since decided macro tracking is not for me (and my excellent Asian cooking style), but if you use [MyfitnessPal](https://www.myfitnesspal.com/), the only manual step is to export and copy data over time to a google spreadsheet.

To use, `git clone https://github.com/yliu0593/plot-fitness-data.git`; run `python main.py`.

P.S. Instruction for setting up authourization on Google API can be found [here](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2017/02/an-easy-way-to-read-and-write-to-a-google-spreadsheet-in-python.html)

P.P.S The cover photo is my personal fitness data, at the time I was following a strict diet miserably. You should be happy to know I am not tracking any currently, and I maintained my weight.
