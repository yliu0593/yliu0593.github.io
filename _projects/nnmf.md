## Motivation

- Damage during X-ray diffraction (XRD) data collection can have a significant impact on the quality of the recovered protein structures.

# Method

- Intensity was decomposed using [Non-negative matrix factorization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-negative_matrix_factorization)


# Results

- X-ray induced damage at cryogenic temperatures is sequential rather than stochastic
