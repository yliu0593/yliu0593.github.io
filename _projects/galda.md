Generative adversareial linear discriminant analysis (GALDA) is demonstrated to enable linear discriminant analysis (LDA) with small numbers of high dimensional data sets and few classes, for which conventional LDA typically exhibits numerical instability. LDA is arguably the simplest supervised method for dimension reduction and spectral classification, retaining validity of common statistical tests lost in nonlinear analyses such as those employing artificial neural networks. Herein, we propose and develop linear generative adversarial strategies to address “overfitting” complications that commonly restrict the direct use of LDA at full rank. The generative adversarial linear discriminant analysis (GALDA) algorithm is inspired by the successes of nonlinear generative adversarial strategies routinely used to minimize overfitting in artificial neural networks. In the analysis of Raman spectra of different crystal forms of the blood thinner clopidogrel bisulfate, five-fold cross-validation of GALDA was shown to support resasonable resolution between three different spectral classes of testing data with as few as three training spectra in each class. By retention of class information, GALDA is shown to provide improvements in resolution compared to principal component analysis (PCA), even in cases for which PCA greatly outperforms conventional LDA (i.e., a small number of high-dimensional training data). The resolution improvements realized by GALDA relative to PCA in regimes hitherto inaccessible by conventional LDA may expand the use of LDA as a broadly applicable platform for linear analysis of supervised data sets.
